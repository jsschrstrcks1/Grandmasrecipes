Select the freshest, top-quality produce. Sort out any bruised or underripe items.","EQUIPMENT: A water-bath canner is used for processing high-acid foods such as fruits, tomatoes (with added acid), pickles, and relishes. The 212\u00b0F temperature produced in the boiling water is sufficient for these foods. A pressure canner is used for processing low-acid foods and vegetables. It reaches temperatures of 240\u00b0F to 250\u00b0F, the safe level for these foods. This canning method must be followed for safe canning of low-acid foods. A 16-quart pressure canner is ideal.","JARS: Use only standard canning jars, and their mouths are specially designed to seal properly for canning. Run your finger over the mouth of the jars to check for any chips or cracks. Discard any jars with chips or cracks. Use them for dry storage only.","LIDS: Use self-sealing compound bands and flat metal lids with built-in sealing compound. Carefully follow the manufacturer's directions when preparing them. Lids are designed for one-time use, but you can reuse screw bands if they are not bent or rusty.","Foods are packed into canning jars by either raw-pack (cold-pack) or the hot-pack method. In raw packing, the uncooked food is packed into jars.","Other useful pieces of equipment are: a large kettle or Dutch oven, wide-mouth funnel, jar lifter and food mill, colander, or sieve.","STEPS: 1. After the jars are completely cooled, press the center of each lid to check the seal. If it dips up and down, the jar is sealed. If the lid bounces and reprocesses the contents using a clean jar and new lid, processing for the full length of time specified. Or, freeze the food (allowing 1/2-inch headspace). If you plan to use the food within a day or two, you also can refrigerate it.","2. Wipe the jars and lids. Label jars with contents and date. Remove the screw bands.
