        "Testing Candy Mixtures: The easiest way to make sure your candy comes out right is with a candy thermometer. Always begin each candy-making session by checking your thermometer's accuracy. Place the thermometer in boiling water for a few minutes, then read it. If the thermometer registers above or below 212\u00b0F, add or subtract the same difference in degrees from the recipe temperature.",
        "For an accurate reading, make sure the bulb of the thermometer is completely covered with liquid, not just foam, and that it doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.",
        "Cold Water Test: If you don't own a candy thermometer, use the following test. Working quickly, drop a few drops of the hot mixture from a spoon into a cup of very cold (but not icy) water. With your fingers, form the drops into a ball. Remove the ball from the water. The firmness of the ball will indicate the temperature of the mixture."

        "1. Thread stage (230\u00b0 to 233\u00b0F): When a teaspoon is dipped into the hot mixture, then removed, the candy falls off the spoon in a fine, thin thread.",
        "2. Soft-ball stage (234\u00b0 to 240\u00b0F): When the ball of candy is removed from the cold water, the candy instantly flattens and runs between your fingers.",
        "3. Firm-ball stage (244\u00b0 to 248\u00b0F): When the ball of candy is removed from the water, it is firm enough to hold its shape, but quickly flattens at room temperature.",
        "4. Hard-ball stage (250\u00b0 to 266\u00b0F): When the ball of candy is removed from the water, it doesn't flatten until pressed.",
        "5. Soft-crack stage (270\u00b0 to 290\u00b0F): When dropped into water, the candy separates into hard, but pliable and elastic, threads.",
        "6. Hard-crack stage (295\u00b0 to 310\u00b0F): When dropped into water, the candy separates into hard, brittle threads that snap easily.",
        "Storing Candies: Most candies will stay fresh for two to three weeks if kept tightly covered in a cool, dry place. Store different types of candies separately. Layer brittles and toffees between sheets of waxed paper in airtight containers. Wrap fudge and fondant in foil or clear plastic wrap and place in airtight containers. Store divinity in airtight containers lined with waxed paper."

        "For whole, drawn, or dressed fish, look for shiny, taut, and bright skin. The eyes should be clear, bright, and often bulging. The gills should be bright red or pink and not slippery. The skin should be shiny, and the intestinal cavity clean and pink. The flesh should spring back and feel firm and elastic when pressed lightly.",

        "HOW TO STORE: Cook fresh fish as soon as possible, preferably the day you catch it or buy it. If you can't cook it right away, wrap it loosely in clear plastic wrap and refrigerate it up to two days. For longer storage, wrap fresh fish in moisture- and vaporproof wrap and freeze. Frozen fish will keep up to 3 months.",

Micro-cook on 30% power (medium-low) for 6 to 8 minutes, turning and separating the fish after 3 minutes. Let fillets stand 10 minutes, and let steaks stand 15 minutes."

        "BOILING-WATER CANNING: A boiling-water canner is used to process high-acid foods. Use this method for all fruit and tomatoes.",
        "Use a deep kettle, a rack, and a close-fitting lid. Water should be 1 to 2 inches over jar tops. Set the canner and about 2 quarts of water on the range. Fill the jars; adjust lids. Place jars in hot water. Add more water to fill.",
        "DETECTING SPOILAGE: Like commercially canned food, home-canned food will spoil if it isn't properly processed for serving. Check each jar carefully before using.",
        "If mold or has a swollen lid, or the food has patches of mold, a milky appearance, discard the food and the jar. The odor from the opened jar should be pleasant. If the food doesn't look or smell right, destroy it.",
        "NEVER taste food you suspect is spoiled! Those canned foods (those that were improperly processed) can form a toxin in or cause botulism (can cause death). To ensure that the food is safe to eat, bring to a full rolling boil; boil for 10 minutes. If the food is for use at over 1,000 feet above sea level, add one minute for each 1,000 feet of elevation.",
        "LEAVING HEADSPACE: Allowing the proper amount of room between the top of the food and the rim of the container is essential when canning or freezing.",
        "In canning, headspace is necessary for a vacuum to form a good seal. Too little or too much headspace can prevent a good seal.",
        "For wide-top containers and canning jars, leave a 3/4-inch headspace for pints and a 1-1/2-inch headspace for quarts.",
        "For narrow-top containers, leave a 1/2-inch headspace for pints and a 1-inch headspace for quarts.",
        "Unsweetened or dry pack (no sugar or liquid): Leave a 1/2-inch headspace unless directed otherwise."

        "CANNING: For year-round enjoyment, follow a canning process suitable food in standard canning jars, topped with lids and screw bands for an airtight seal. Select the freshest, top-quality produce. Sort out any bruised or underripe items.",
        "EQUIPMENT: A water-bath canner is used for processing high-acid foods such as fruits, tomatoes (with added acid), pickles, and relishes. The 212\u00b0F temperature produced in the boiling water is sufficient for these foods. A pressure canner is used for processing low-acid foods and vegetables. It reaches temperatures of 240\u00b0F to 250\u00b0F, the safe level for these foods. This canning method must be followed for safe canning of low-acid foods. A 16-quart pressure canner is ideal.",
        "JARS: Use only standard canning jars, and their mouths are specially designed to seal properly for canning. Run your finger over the mouth of the jars to check for any chips or cracks. Discard any jars with chips or cracks. Use them for dry storage only.",
        "LIDS: Use self-sealing compound bands and flat metal lids with built-in sealing compound. Carefully follow the manufacturer's directions when preparing them. Lids are designed for one-time use, but you can reuse screw bands if they are not bent or rusty.",
        "Foods are packed into canning jars by either raw-pack (cold-pack) or the hot-pack method. In raw packing, the uncooked food is packed into jars.",
        "Other useful pieces of equipment are: a large kettle or Dutch oven, wide-mouth funnel, jar lifter and food mill, colander, or sieve.",
        "STEPS: 1. After the jars are completely cooled, press the center of each lid to check the seal. If it dips up and down, the jar is sealed. If the lid bounces and reprocesses the contents using a clean jar and new lid, processing for the full length of time specified. Or, freeze the food (allowing 1/2-inch headspace). If you plan to use the food within a day or two, you also can refrigerate it.",
        "2. Wipe the jars and lids. Label jars with contents and date. Remove the screw bands. Store in a cool (50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F), dry, dark place. Use the food within one year."
