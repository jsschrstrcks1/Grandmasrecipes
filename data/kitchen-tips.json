(Do not use spread, diet, or soft-style margarine products in cookie doughs. Your cookies will not turn out satisfactorily.) When using corn-oil margarine, make the following adjustments so your dough will be easier to handle: For sliced cookies, chill the rolls of dough in the freezer instead of the refrigerator. For rolled cookies, chill the dough before rolling it, or freeze it just until it's firm enough to roll. With a standard mixer, start mixing on low speed so you don't sling the flour out of the bowl. If you use a portable mixer when making cookies and notice that it strains or becomes hot, stir in any remaining ingredients by hand. Many cookie doughs are so stiff that beating them with a portable mixer may not be possible, especially when you're adding the last of the flour.",

Cool layer cakes in their pans on wire racks for 10 minutes (loaf cakes, 15 minutes), then loosen the edges. Place an inverted rack on each cake and turn over; lift off the pan. Place a second rack over the cake and invert again. Invert angel, sponge, and chiffon cakes in their pans as soon as they are removed from the oven to prevent them from shrinking or falling.

          "text": "With a little help from your microwave oven, you may be able to significantly shorten the time it takes to proof (raise) your yeast breads. Before you begin, check your owner's manual to see if proofing is recommended. Or use the following test to check your oven: Place 2 tablespoons cold stick margarine in a custard cup in the center of your oven. Micro-cook, uncovered, on 10% power (low) for 4 minutes. If the margarine doesn't completely melt, your microwave can proof yeast dough. But if the margarine does completely melt, your microwave will kill the yeast before the bread has a chance to rise. If so, you'll have to raise your yeast breads conventionally. If your oven passed the test, here's how to proceed: While kneading your dough, place 3 cups water in a 4-cup measure. Cook on 100% power (high) for 6½ to 8½ minutes or till boiling. Move measure to back of oven. Place kneaded dough in a greased bowl, turning once. Cover with waxed paper and place in microwave oven with hot water. Heat dough and water on 10% power (low) for 13 to 15 minutes or till dough has almost doubled. Punch dough down; shape as directed. Then place shaped dough in 8x4x2- or 9x5x3-inch loaf dishes. Return to microwave with hot water. Cover with waxed paper. Heat on low 6 to 8 minutes or till nearly doubled. (For round or long loaves that are shaped on baking sheets, or rolls that are shaped in muffin cups, you'll have to do the second proofing step conventionally.) For rich yeast breads (those with eggs and a slightly higher proportion of sugar), proofing times will be slightly longer. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the first proofing time, and 10 to 14 minutes for the second proofing time.",

What makes confectioners' coating so easy is that it doesn't speckle as it hardens and that it easily heats without scorching. Before dipping candy, chop the coating and melt it in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Semisweet chocolate and milk chocolate also can be used for dipping. But these products usually need to be tempered (melted and then cooled to the correct dipping temperature). Without tempering, the chocolate often speckles or develops gray streaks as it hardens. This speckling is called blooming and affects only the appearance, not the quality or flavor, of the candy. If a small amount of speckling doesn't bother you, go ahead and use untempered chocolate for dipping. To learn more about tempering, see a candy-making cookbook.",
