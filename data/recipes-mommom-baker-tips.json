If you will brown the flour well before adding to the liquid when making gravy, you will avoid pale or lumpy gravy.

Thin gravy can be thickened by adding a mixture of flour or cornstarch and water, added gradually, stirring constantly, while bringing to a boil. Lumpless gravy can be your triumph if you add a pinch of salt to the flour before mixing it with water. A small amount of baking soda added to gravy will eliminate excess grease.",

      "content": "When baking large cakes, brownies, or moist bars, place a juice glass in the center of the baking dish to prevent a soggy middle and ensure uniform baking throughout. Since cakes and quick breads rise higher in a microwave oven, fill pans just half full of batter. Using a round dish instead of a square one eliminates overcooked corners in baking cakes. When preparing chicken in a dish, place meaty pieces around the edges and the bony pieces in the center of the dish. Shaping meatloaf into a ring eliminates undercooked center (a glass set in the center of a dish can serve as the mold). A crusty coating of chopped walnuts surrounding many microwave-cooked cakes and quick breads enhances the looks and eating quality. Sprinkle a layer of medium finely chopped walnuts evenly onto the bottom and sides of a ring pan or Bundt cake pan. Pour in batter and microwave as recipe directs.",
