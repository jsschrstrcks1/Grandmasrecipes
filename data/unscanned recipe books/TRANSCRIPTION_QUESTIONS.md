## Questions

### Cookbook 3: Centennial Recipes (Elk Rapids)

1. **Household Hints page (IMG_7401)** - Should the cooking tips be saved as a separate "tips" entry or as individual tip records? Examples include:
   - "To prevent milk from scorching when scalding, rinse the pan in water to moisten it before putting in the milk"
   - "Sugar in fried cakes, fritters, etc., should always be added to the milk - this prevents the cakes from absorbing the fat in frying"
   - "Add one drop of vanilla and beat well just before serving chocolate, and notice the improved delicacy of flavor"
   - Many more helpful tips on this page

2. **Inspirational quotes** - Many pages have quotes at the bottom (e.g., "It takes both rain and sunshine to make a rainbow" on page 90). Should these be preserved somewhere?
